    "## Challenges With Evaluating GANs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loss is Uninformative of Performance\n",
    "One aspect that makes evaluating GANs challenging is that the loss tells us little about their performance. Unlike with classifiers, where a low loss on a test set indicates superior performance, a low loss for the generator or discriminator suggests that learning has stopped. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No Clear Non-human Metric\n",
    "If you define the goal of a GAN as \"generating images which look real to people\" then it's technically possible to measure this directly: [you can ask people to act as a discriminator](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01121). However, this takes significant time and money so ideally you can use a proxy for this. There is also no \"perfect\" discriminator that can differentiate reals from fakes - if there were, a lot of machine learning tasks would be solved ;)\n",

    "In this notebook, you will implement Fréchet Inception Distance, one method which aims to solve these issues. "
